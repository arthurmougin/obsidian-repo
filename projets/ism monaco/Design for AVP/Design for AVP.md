# Design recommendations
## Intentional
- encourage key moment unique to vision os

- find how to make new things possible

- Models
	- need photorealistic
	- bring them to life with animation

- do a lot of prototyping
- build something complementary if too many informations â†’ cross platform

## Immersive example
- transport people somewhere new
![](Pasted%20image%2020241212103812.png)
- great environments replicate an accurate sense of depth and scale
- or consider physical surendings (ex: splats on walls)
- design meaningful sound (sound is computed to feel like it belong to your real environment)

## Comfortable
- require minimal movement
- keep windows to a minimal and cohesive uis
![](Pasted%20image%2020241212104006.png)
- keep related ui elements close to one another (you can put menus outside a window but anchor them to it)
- keep stuff into a minimal of ui panels to avoid user having to manage all the uis

- no light and dark mode, use the real world lighting with glass textures
- hover effects for interactive elements
- use at least 60 points of space for tap targets 
## Delightful
- honor spacial awareness 
	- arm reach = interactive, keep items close if they are interactive
	- use cues to help understand what to do
- Create real-world parity
	- mimic real world interactions
	- do user testing
- Abstract away complexities
	- automate some features that used to need to be done manually in the real world
